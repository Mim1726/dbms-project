# Admin Results Section Redesign - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Election Status Detection Problem**
**Problem**: The CSEDU Election from August 22, 2025 was still showing as "ONGOING" even though it ended 8 days ago (current date: August 30, 2025).

**Root Cause**: The election status logic in `elections.js` was using only the `election_date` field and `is_active` flag, but not properly checking against the voting schedule (`voting_start` and `voting_end` dates).

**Solution**: 
- Updated `getElectionStatus()` method in `elections.js` to prioritize schedule dates over election dates
- Added proper logic to check `voting_end` date from the schedule table
- Falls back to election_date + 1 day buffer if no schedule exists
- Now correctly identifies elections as "Ended" when voting period has passed

### 2. **Enhanced Admin Results Dashboard**
**Problem**: The admin results section lacked detailed voting analysis and comprehensive reporting features.

**New Features Added**:

#### **Comprehensive Election Results Display**
- **Live vs Completed Elections**: Proper categorization with visual indicators
- **Detailed Metadata**: Shows voting period, duration, participant count
- **Real-time Status**: Live pulse indicator for ongoing elections

#### **Individual Candidate Vote Tracking**
- **"View Voters" Button**: Shows exactly who voted for each candidate

### 3. **Database Integration Improvements**

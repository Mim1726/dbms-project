# Election Status Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The elections "Women Leadership Poll", "City Council Election", and "Mayor Election" were incorrectly showing as "Ended" and appearing in the "Past Elections" section, even though their voting periods haven't started yet.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `getElectionStatus()` function in `js/elections.js`. The function had a logical flaw in the fallback logic when determining election status based on the `election_date` field.

### Original Problematic Logic:

```javascript
// Fallback to election_date comparison
if (electionDate > now) {
    // Future election logic...
} else {
    // This treated elections as "past" even if they were scheduled for today/tomorrow
    const daysDiff = (now - electionDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
    if (daysDiff > 1) {
        return 'Ended';
    }
    // ...
}
```

## The Fix

### 1. Improved Fallback Logic

Updated the fallback comparison to use `>=` instead of `>`:

```javascript
// Always prefer future dates as upcoming when no schedule is available
if (electionDate >= now) {
    return 'Upcoming';
} else {
    // Only treat as past if actually in the past
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Cache Busting

Updated the version number in `index.html` from `v=1.5` to `v=1.6` to force browser cache refresh:

```html
<script src="js/elections.js?v=1.6"></script>
```

## Expected Results After Fix

Based on the current date (September 4, 2025) and the voting schedules:

| Election | Voting Period | Expected Status | Expected Section |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Women Leadership Poll** | Nov 5-10, 2025 | **Upcoming** | Upcoming Elections |
| **City Council Election** | Oct 10-15, 2025 | **Upcoming** | Upcoming Elections |
| **Mayor Election** | Sep 1-5, 2025 | **Active** | Ongoing Elections |

## Database Schedule Reference

From `supabase-sample-data.sql`:

```sql
-- Women Leadership Poll (election_id: 305)
(405, 305, '2025-08-15 00:00:00', '2025-08-25 23:59:59', '2025-11-05 08:00:00', '2025-11-10 18:00:00', '2025-11-11 10:00:00'),

-- City Council Election (election_id: 302)  
(402, 302, '2025-08-01 00:00:00', '2025-08-10 23:59:59', '2025-10-10 08:00:00', '2025-10-15 18:00:00', '2025-10-16 10:00:00'),

-- Mayor Election (election_id: 304)
(404, 304, '2025-08-01 00:00:00', '2025-08-05 23:59:59', '2025-09-01 08:00:00', '2025-09-05 18:00:00', '2025-09-06 10:00:00')
```

## Testing

Created test files to verify the fix:
- `debug-election-status.html` - Debug version with logging
- `test-election-fix.html` - Visual verification of correct status

## Files Modified

1. **`js/elections.js`** - Fixed the `getElectionStatus()` function logic
2. **`index.html`** - Updated script version to `v=1.6` for cache busting

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Clear browser cache or hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Navigate to the Elections section
3. Verify that:
   - Women Leadership Poll and City Council Election appear in "Upcoming Elections"
   - Mayor Election appears in "Ongoing Elections" (if current date is between Sep 1-5)
   - All three elections show appropriate status badges

The fix ensures that elections are properly categorized based on their actual voting schedules rather than falling back to potentially incorrect election_date comparisons.
